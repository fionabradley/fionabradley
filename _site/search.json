    "text": "Talk presented at WLIC2021 18 August 2021\n\n“…but A.I\ncan solve all our problems\nbut where do ethics go”\nWang Leehom《A.I. 愛》\n\nWe are already living in an algorithmic society. But, while we now understand more about bias in machine learning sets, the surveillance risks of smart cities and facial recognition (Van Noorden, 2020), upload filtering and content moderation on social networks (Gillespie, 2020; Llansó, 2020), policies and regulation are still emerging.\nSome of the key challenges in AI regulation are that:\n\nThe intersection between AI, privacy, and human rights is still emerging. It is necessary to make the case for how AI impacts human rights as well as to address equity, ethics, and fairness.\nLaws are important, but other forms of regulation or influence apart from top-down rules are also key (Moses, 2015). These can include setting research agendas, funding, engagement in standards development, and geopolitical positioning (Smuha, 2021).\n“AI” as a concept is as broad and difficult to define as “data”, or “information”, and thus cannot be readily confined to specific applications. This is evident in different approaches to regulation to date, whether risk-based, or sector-based.\n\nThe current policy and regulatory landscape is evolving in multiple ways:\n\nAlong broad values and rights-based lines: trustworthy, responsible, ethical AI are all terms describing a similar approach (Smuha, 2021) that in some cases are also evolving into more binding regulation. In Europe, for example, guidelines for trustworthy AI were adopted in 2019 and proposed harmonised rules for risk-based regulation in 2021 (European Parliament, 2021). Australia has developed a rights-based approach and adopted a voluntary AI and ethics framework (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2021; Department of Industry, Science, Energy, and Resources, 2021)\nAt the same time, AI has become a point of geopolitical positioning and competition between Europe, the US, and China and other countries that all seek to lead in AI innovation, and regulation (Smuha, 2021). This results in policies and plans that incorporate issues such as research investment, intellectual property, export controls, but that also seek to influence. China’s New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan incorporates ethical considerations, but also research funding and education (Roberts et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). In Europe, the proposed regulation seeks to influence state and corporate behaviour (Tanna, 2021).\n\nOther countries such as the US are pursuing a sectoral approach (MacCarthy, 2020). This reflects the vast difference between AI powered search engines (less risk), algorithmic decision-making by government (Henriques-Gomes, 2021), and military applications (high risk).\nBodies like the OECD and UNESCO are also looking at regulation across multiple countries (Smuha, 2021)\nAnd, there is renewed attention to other forms of regulation including technical and professional standards (Rachovitsa, 2016; Raymond & DeNardis, 2015).\n\nSo, what does all this mean for libraries? Regulation will shape the types of technologies available in different countries and industries, the ways that people can seek remedies if their rights are violated, and the societies that we will live in. In this context, it is not surprising that librarians have a range of views about AI, from embracing its potential to deep scepticism and alarm. Meanwhile, many vendors and startups based on library metadata are already promoting AI as part of their products. But there is not yet enough disclosure or transparency about how these features really work, nor what ethical standards vendors are holding themselves to. More debate is needed to build consensus about where the profession stands in relation to these issues, and it is important to incorporate existing national ethical AI frameworks into procurement decisions, and guidance about these issues to library users.\nIn Australia, The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) responded to the consultation on Australia’s voluntary AI framework observing that AI provides opportunities for service improvement as well as potential threats. They noted that, “Library and information professionals will need training and ongoing learning to enable us to understand and apply principles for ethical AI in our business practices.”(Australian Library and Information Association, 2019). According to current ALIA guidelines, entry-level librarians in Australia are expected to know about AI and ML.\nHigh profile failures in algorithmic decision-making by government means that some of the potential risks associated with these technologies are already widely known in Australia. A massive failure that became known as “Robodebt” used algorithmic decision-making to identify people who received money from Centrelink, a government public benefit program, and incorrectly matched their information with other datasets in the Australian Taxation Office. As a result, hundreds of thousands of people received letters falsely stating that they owed huge debts to the government. In June 2021, a $1.8 billion settlement was reached to resolve the matter (Henriques-Gomes, 2021).\nThere is also a very large program of research work on algorithmic fairness in Australia from a wide range of perspectives. These include the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S), and a significant report on Human Rights and Technology released in 2021 which recommends accountability mechanisms for government and corporations, and compliance with anti-discrimination laws to promote algorithmic fairness (Australian Human Rights Commission, 2021).\nIncorporating these national level recommendations provides a robust foundation for the ways in which libraries can contribute to a more fair society and work with vendors to protect user privacy."

    "text": "A few thoughts in advance of a panel talk being hosted 21 February 2023 by ALIA: AI, libraries, and the changing face of information literacy. See you there.\nChatbots: Pity the chatbot. The derided “computer says no” tool that seemed to be known more for blocking direct human interaction with shops, banks, airlines, and insurance companies has finally found affection, and an extraordinary amount of free publicity, via OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nReleased in late 2022, the latest version of ChatGPT 3.5 is billed as a limited research beta. How long it remains freely available is anyone’s guess. The tool is said to have triggered a new AI race with competitors including Google, Microsoft, and Baidu (more a coincidence of timing than by design, I would say), reflection on AI regulation, and a fair amount of existential angst about what makes writing innately human, truth, and ethics.\nWe probably won’t be talking about ChatGPT a few months from now. But we will almost certainly be talking about how generative text and creative AI tools are embedded and largely invisible in existing everyday activities and applications. If we think we have a problem with ‘black-boxing’ and non-transparent algorithms now things are about to get a whole lot more complicated. Some of these innovations will save time and effort and be genuinely fun and interesting to use. Others will further entrench inequities in the labour required to remove abhorrent content from training data, bias, and a lack of respect for creators’ rights."

    "text": "AI ethics: or why this stuff keeps people up at night\nAI ethics captures a vast range of concerns. Even within the library and information profession, whose very foundation is built on the value of access to quality information and patron privacy, there is insufficient debate about what new technologies and methodologies like AI and ML mean for services and the people that library serve. Privacy of personal data is affected by harvesting for training data, bias is common, and algorithmic decision-making that goes wrong can have major consequences.\nA growing ethical debate concerns an apparent lack of respect for creator rights when ingesting content and creating training models. ChatGPT has apparently ingested the contents of Archive of our Own, a prominent fanfic archive, without the consent of its authors. Reddit and Wikipedia are also thought to be major sources that have helped create ChatGPT’s generic English writing style. It seems any open content on the web is fair game for these models, regardless of whether authors have morally consented to their work being used in this way. “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should” (cf: Jurassic Park), of course. Even more controversial is the use of images for generative creative works and art. Or the use of AI to replace artists working on the backgrounds of an anime series. Expect to see more ethical and legal issues in this space and a lot more lawsuits as generative creative AI tools begin to be integrated directly into consumer software as well.\nAs for whether a tool that does not respect creator rights can itself be an author, the answer already seems clear cut: no.\nFor libraries, ethical issues in AI and ML ought to trigger a resurgence in information literacy. I have said frequently over the years that I cannot understand why a media and information literacy course is not the most popular and oversubscribed course at every university (and school and public library). I mean media and information literacy skills that deconstruct sources of knowledge, invested interests, and allow people to critically appraise the veracity of what they are reading, viewing, and hearing. I often reflect on conversations with colleagues around 2015 from Ukraine, Romania, Finland, Denmark that were ringing the alarm bell about a lack of appreciation for debate, democratic values, and truth. As we have seen in Europe, the US and elsewhere in the years since, these values have been sorely tested. Finland’s forethought to invest in ensuring young people have these skills in the face of endemic misinformation has proved to be visionary.\nA technique used by autocrats and others to drown out genuine information is called “flooding”. With the rise of more widely available generative AI text tools, I worry that the bots are about to get a lot more ammunition. Each technological development reduces the costs and time required to create an awful lot of havoc. It is trivial to create a bot army on any given issue and drown out legitimate voices online on social media platforms and in search engine results. Such tactics are not unique to autocracies. Steve Bannon’s “flood the zone”, anyone? Search engines are already struggling to cope with filtering out low quality SEO generated content. Add in a barrage of sort-of-correct-sounding, intersparsed with incorrect AI generated text, fake references, deepfake images and video and it will be even harder to find reliable information, especially in a crisis.\nAI hallucinations are a longstanding phenomenon, but are said to be accelerating with the development of large language models. What ChatGPT and other LLMs don’t ‘know’ based on their training data they may just make up. As is evident when we see fake citations and other made up information. Basic errors in fact are one thing. But what will the response be when these errors are about people and incorrect facts could be seen as defamatory. Years on from the Google News Spain case and right to be forgotten, how do we ask a language model to ‘forget’ what it doesn’t really know?\nGarbage in, garbage out, as the saying goes. No wonder some say ChatGPT is just a mansplainer. These risks might sound farfetched. But consider OpenAI’s own comments a couple of years ago in the context of EU regulations on upload filters and potential to alter/censor content for European audiences:\n\n“…the designers of the futuristic OpenAI system, which can create limitless deepfakes for text including negative and positive customer reviews, spam and fake news that are sufficiently persuasive to be plausible as human creations, decided to raise the alarm. Indeed, perhaps not surprisingly, the public has already been alerted to the fact that the technology is too dangerous to release for fear of its potential abuse (The Guardian News, February 14, 2019).” (Romero Moreno, 2020, p. 174)\n\nToo dangerous to release. And yet, here we are.\nLike content moderation before it, ChatGPT has also revealed troubling realities about how tools are trained so that we don’t see the most hateful, violent, illegal content. This labour is cheap to the companies that use it, but comes at a very high psychological cost to people that undertake the work.\nTo address questions of bias, among other intentions, there has been a groundswell of regulatory activity in China and the EU to require companies to open up their algorithms. Sina Weibo’s hot search is one algorithm that has been highly scrutinized. While many results are genuine and organic, the list can be gamed. Members of fanclubs, for instance, spend a great deal of effort trying to influence hot searches about their favourite entertainers while “antis” try to damage their idol’s perceived competitors. Successive crackdowns on toxic fan culture, campaigns to “clean up” the internet, an overriding emphasis on security, as well as regulations about data protection all provide context for the introduction of regulations to publish algorithms in mid-2021. Early reviews of the approach in China suggests that while regulation has helped to push for some transparency, algorithms are so complex and what companies report at times so vague that it is unclear what the regulations can achieve.\nThis could be a preview of what happens in other regions that go down the same regulatory road. For different reasons, the EU is rolling out an approach as part of the Digital Services Act. The EU approach is motivated by concerns about the influence of largely US-based multinational platforms used by EU citizens, and taps into the EU’s longstanding orientation as a regulatory leader."

    "text": "Is it all doom and gloom? No\nYes there’s a lot to worry about, and a lot to get right to ensure that the future of generative, large language model AI is ethical and trustworthy. These are keywords in the plans and minds of many regulators, and people having a go in using OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bing, Google “Bard”, the forthcoming Baidu “Ernie Bot”, and whatever tools come next.\nThe more likely scenario in the short-term is that we are going to see a lot more AI whether real or just hype. Be extra critical of apps ending in the domain name .ai. We will see new tools embedded into search products, bibliographic tools, word processors, spreadsheets and the like. Some of this is already happening - for instance subjects in some bibliographic tools are applied using machine learning, and many recommender tools use ML. If you are familiar with the Editor function in Microsoft Word or tools like Grammarly expect to see more like that. Much of this will be invisible. It will make it easier to correct your spelling and get help on how to use a particular function. I’d honestly be delighted if a company put all their attention into a fully functional and automated meeting scheduler that can account for internal and external people, hybrid and online formats, and timezones. Just an idea, Microsoft.\nWe are far from being put out of a job. Or losing our humanity. Not in 2023. I am convinced there’s more to do than ever for those who research these issues and for those working in libraries to ensure that we ensure the next wave of media and information literacy is fit for the algorithmic age, that research data is correctly described so that it can be ethically reused, and that we collaborate closely with researchers and integrity staff to ensure matters of authorship, attribution, accuracy in scholarly publishing in the face of new technologies is well understood."

    "text": "I’m often asked, such as in a recent webinar on research for ALIA, “how is your thesis going, anyway?”. Depending on the day I’ll either respond, “still going”, or launch into a long-winded overview of my latest observations. Fitting a part-time PhD around a day job and other professional commitments is not something to take on lightly.\nCon asks, how do you find books to read? My research spans some very fast moving topics and there is a lot to keep up with. At the same time, I have been warned to not read too much. It’s a balancing act especially when getting up to speed with a new area quickly.\nMany reading sources come from traditional research advice: find a key scholar or work in a field, read them, and citation chain to identify other relevant materials. Foreign Affairs, The Economist, LA Review of Books and Arts & Letters Daily are mainstays for book reviews. ISA’s annual human rights book award is also worth checking.\nSocial media, especially Twitter, has also helped me find many relevant books. After Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, I set up a profile on Mastodon and combed through every account I followed to subscribe to newsletters and feeds in case their profile disappeared. Yet most scholars I follow have not migrated away from Twitter. The resulting information overload in following and digesting so many sources to find relevant information is very much felt.\nAt the same time, while there is danger in reading too much, I am a great fan of ‘reading around’ to have a better sense of history, context, and culture especially when working on somewhat technical, sometimes very dry research topics. This also provides an opportunity to introduce a broader range of sources into the mix, or simply ideas that run parallel to a research question. Some recent books that I’ve enjoyed in this vein:\nJing Tsu, Kingdom of characters: The language revolution that made China modern\nMegan Walsh, The Subplot: What China is reading and why it matters\nFrank Dikötter, China after Mao\nJenny Odell, How to do Nothing\nIn the era of generative AI where many of the conversations about the use of text tools to effectively game learning is leading to a very narrow approach where students only want to be exposed to ideas that have the greatest utility (ie, ‘is this on the test?’), I find it essential to make time for reading broadly and for fun. Even if the result is that the thesis is “still going”. It will all get done, one day."

They lay out a plan for all countries to actively engage in making our world better for its people and the planet.\nThe UN 2030 Agenda is a political commitment, which means that everyone, including libraries and civil society, has a role in making sure all countries meet the goals and leave no one behind. The outcomes are not legally binding. However, the monitoring and follow-up process is taken seriously, and includes both thematic and voluntary national reviews every year as part of the UN High-Level Political Forum.\nThere are two things I want you to keep in mind throughout this presentation:\n\nAgenda 2030 is more than the SDGs\nThe purpose of the SDGs or Agenda 2030 is for UN Member States to achieve the Goals"

    "text": "Origins of the SDGs\nA little bit of the backstory about where the new Agenda came from helps set the context for what the UN is trying to achieve.\nBefore the SDGs came the Millennium Development Goals that ended in 2015. Success in achieving the MDGs was very mixed. As the UN neared the end of the MDG process, various conferences and documents began to lay the groundwork to negotiate the next process. Starting in 2012, this became known as the “post-2015 process”. From the outset, the post-2015 process was intended to be much more inclusive than the MDGs, which were very top-down.\nThis meant that civil society would be able to play a much bigger role than before in advocacy and helping to shape the new goals. Over three years, this was an extremely intensive and political process.\nLibraries got involved in the process early on. IFLA took the lead as they have consultative status with ECOSOC which means they are allowed to register to participate in UN meetings as part of the civil society delegation. The work was largely led by a couple of staff at IFLA in close collaboration with the Board, and two US-based Governing Board members who could attend all the UN meetings in New York.\nI’m able to share this origin story with you because I was one of those staff members and my job was to respond to consultations, prepare briefings for Ministers, build coalitions with other NGOs, train librarians to respond in their own countries, and write advocacy toolkits. And I also got my turn to attend sessions at the UN in New York, and other conferences with stakeholders and Ministers. It was a huge amount of work, but a lot of fun too.\nSo why did libraries get involved so early? Past experience had shown that the process matters: documents and positions are built up over many iterations and a long period of time. If we wanted our issues to be part of the agenda, libraries needed to have a seat at the table from the start. The other reason is that the 2030 Agenda would have some influence in shaping where governments allocate their attention and resources, and this was a huge opportunity to build the case for investing in access to information and libraries that colleagues could call on in their country."

The indicators matter because these help to track progress towards meeting the Goals.\n\nApart from access to information, libraries were also strong supporters of targets for access to the internet and ICTs, and culture. Both of which in turn also contribute to open access, because without access to the internet you cannot access information online, and without culture you cannot recognize the value of local and multilingual knowledge."

    "section": "Framing access to information",
    "text": "Framing access to information\nThe 17 SDGs address issues like land, water, poverty, education, and industry. Some of these are less controversial than others. The Goal on Peace and Justice was more challenging for Member States to agree on, and for a time was at risk of being dropped entirely. The language about public access to information changed multiple times. An additional challenge is that many civil society organisations define access to information only in the context of Right to Information laws or Freedom of Information but it was really critical that it consider access more broadly. The rationale for this was set out in the Lyon Declaration on Access to Information and Development. It was a great success that it was finally adopted in the form you see today.\nYou might have noticed some words are not included in any of these statements. Nowhere are there any words about libraries, or open access. That’s because in a process as high-level and consensus-driven as this one, you have to identify language and terms that will get other stakeholders on board. There’s also a lot of advocacy to get other NGOs, media organisations, rights activists on board before you can make the case to government. The key is then to use those coalitions to advocate for what you want to achieve more specifically.\nThis framing and language about access to information also sits within a larger human rights-based context. Many NGOs and campaigners work on issues like freedom of expression and access to information, and have argued that access to information is necessary to democracy and underpins all other rights. So you can hear echoes of that approach when we talk about things like access to information and open access underpinning the achievement of all the other goals."

    "text": "The contribution of open access to the SDGs\nWhile the 2030 Agenda does not include the phrase open access, it has an obvious connection to target 16.10. Public access to information through means such as open access helps people to exercise their civil and political rights, be economically active, learn new skills, enrich cultural identity, and take part in decisionmaking (as outlined in the Lyon Declaration).\nHowever, as I mentioned before, the 2030 Agenda is broader than the SDGs and includes a range of related processes to monitoring, financing, and partnerships to support the Goals. In other words, who is going to pay for it, and how will we know when the Goals have been met.\nThe UN recognised that research and data were critical to this understanding. In 2015, UN recommended the development of an open access knowledge platform to bring together the scientific knowledge that underpins the SDGs. IFLA welcomed this recommendation at the time, and it’s very encouraging that the platform is now under development and harvests research from existing Open Access repositories as well as and UN agencies. This demonstrates high-level, global recognition of the value of open access in meeting global challenges.\nThis example also highlights that although the SDGs are the part of the 2030 Agenda most people know best, all parts of the Agenda are relevant. Not many people would have expected open access (or in UN language, Technology Facilitation Mechanism) to turn up in the discussions in Addis Ababa about what it would cost to implement the SDGs.\nSince the SDGs were adopted, we’ve seen great strides in open access and open science in intergovernmental agencies, many of which have adopted open access policies and licences for their own outputs, the growth of UN data platforms, and also the draft recommendation on open science at UNESCO. This is fantastic progress in a short period of time."

    "text": "How much progress has been made since 2015?\nThat’s the background to the process and what was achieved in 2015, and some of the high-level achievements in open access since that time. We’re now five years in with less than a decade until 2030. What else has been achieved since then?\nThe monitoring process is a critical part of identifying whether UN Member States are on track to meet the goals.\nStepping back a little bit from the SDGs specifically, indicators and data are a critical way that civil society can hold governments to account for progress on any number of issues. In the human rights and access to information space, there are numerous reports that track progress on press freedom, access to the internet, regime types and so on. For example, these include Freedom in the World report from Freedom House, World Press Freedom Index statistics. There are also data compiled by intergovernmental organisations from official statistics, such as the ITU that tracks mobile phone and internet access, and the World Bank Governance Indicators. While it might seem that we are awash in research reports and open data from everywhere, at the start of the SDGs the UN was concerned that many countries still lacked the ability to provide data on basic information such as the number of births in their country. That type of very basic gap means that it is very difficult to identify who needs services.\nSo this is why monitoring and data has become a very important part of the process. Without data, we cannot really understand whether progress has been made. Different UN agencies are responsible for monitoring the 232 indicators in the SDGs. The main event where these data are reported are the annual UN High-Level Political Forum.\nSo knowing that one of the main activities of some civil society organisations is to produce data and reports, that’s exactly what many have done for the SDGs to help complement official statistics and reports. For example, I helped to establish the Development and Access to Information report, DA2I. But many groups also contribute directly to the official monitoring processes which are called Voluntary National Reviews and thematic reviews.\nEveryone can make a direct contribution to sharing their story about how open access makes a difference as part of this process. For example, ALIA, LIANZA, and CAUL have been active in this topic on behalf of libraries in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. This advocacy has paid off with libraries recognised in Australia’s first National Voluntary Review, libraries were also a part of the people’s review in New Zealand.\nGroups of countries are asked to report back on their progress each year. IFLA recently analysed the Voluntary National Reviews submitted to date, and found that nearly half of the reports presented in 2021 mentioned libraries or information. This shows just how possible it is to make impact at a high level, and how useful and important it is that if you are working on the SDGs to ensure you share your stories.\nA story could be very big, or it could be much more local. It’s the impact that matters. For example, stories about open access might look at how access to research helped identify existing treatments that would be useful for COVID19, or make more visible neglected tropical diseases that lack sufficient funding and attention. It could look at how open access supports student start ups, or how a researcher at your institution was able to reach more readers in different countries than before. Your story could be about the difference your whole library makes, or the impact of one researcher, or one discovery, on the lives of others.\nBack in 2015, I would sometimes hear that access to information had been solved and was not a problem anymore. This was because everyone has a phone, and lots of countries have Right to Information legislation. But as librarians, we know that the digital divide and gaps in literacy skills exist in every library, community, and country. Since 2015, we have seen the rise of misinformation and disinformation as key concerns in elections, and around the COVID-19 pandemic. Open access and rapid access to scientific outputs from preprints through to published articles and data have become a key means of ensuring people have access to facts and quality information.\nAt the local level, using stories, libraries globally have embraced the Goals and incorporated them into their work. It’s so rewarding that to see that so many libraries now are engaged with the SDGs when all this started with a very small group of people to build the case for libraries, grow advocates, and provide reusable resources for others to adapt and build on.\nMuch of this work has involved mapping stories to the goals and showing how open access and access to information underpin each of the Goals in different communities. This is a fantastic way to raise awareness about the role of the Goals in each of our daily lives. Many universities have adopted strategies around Grand Challenges or undertaking research that supports the SDGs, and this is also a great way to show the impact of research and open access.\nBut I would also encourage you to go further to share these stories with CAUL, CONZUL, ALIA, LIANZA, and IFLA. It’s so critical to have more of these stories and data at the national level as the official monitoring process continues."

    "text": "What are the SDGs for?\nThis is important to remember too because it’s important to keep a focus on what the SDGs are for.\nIn addition to all the official data and reports, and contributions from civil society, in relation to open access and research we’ve seen that all of the main bibliographic tools have mapped research in their indexes to the Goals. Combined with open access filters, this may be useful in getting a sense of how a country or institution’s output maps to the goals, and is similar to an overview of research by FoR code. It can also be useful to identify resources to learn more about different aspects of the SDGs.\nBut, just my opinion, there are also some activities that perhaps aren’t quite as useful, and that can divert energy away from more meaningful activities. For example, Times Higher Education’s Impact Ranking “are the only global performance tables that assess universities against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).” But unfortunately, the ranking is a missed opportunity to show just how much universities contribute to open access, research, and their communities as it has no meaningful alignment with any official monitoring or review process.\nIn addition to that major gap, there are some other omissions. Goal 16 would have been a perfect opportunity to include open access, but it is missing. But other areas could have referenced open access too - one of the key measures under innovation is Patents citing university research (15.4%). No Poverty has a measure looking at co-authorship with researchers in low income countries. but again, nothing about open access to research. Sustainable Cities and Communities has the closest indicator that could possibly include open access, concerning public access to libraries: “Provide public access to libraries including books and publications”.\nSo once again, what are the SDGs for? They are not an exercise to rank institutions on how we are doing, but a means of ensuring no one is left behind, and that governments meet their commitments by investing in policies and services that make a difference in people’s lives and that support the planet."

    "text": "Monitoring progress of open access - official and unofficial sources\nLet’s turn to how open access is tracking in the 2030 Agenda.\nWe can look at data collected by UNESCO, which is the custodian for 16.10 (access to information) data.\nWe can look at third-party data such as open access rates by country over the last few years. The Leiden Ranking and various bibliographic databases can source this data.\nPlus the subsequent development of instruments like the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science show just how much commitment and interest there is in open access among governments and UNESCO.\nA few other sources of official and unofficial SDG and open access data for national level reporting could include:\n\nOur World in Data SDG Tracker\nIFLA and TASCHA DA2I dashboards\nTAP Network SDG Accountability Report\n\nEach year the UN prepares a narrative report on progress towards the Goals. There has been some progress on areas related to open access, access to information and data, but also remaining challenges. The most recent report on data under Goal 17 notes the contributions of civil society, the private sector and academia, but that there are many gaps still.\nYou can also dig into the datasets to get a sense of progress. If you want a readymade sense of progress, there’s the UN stats progress charts which has a series of dials to track how things are going. Unfortunately not all indicators are reported on every year, but I think you will get a sense of the challenges from this year’s report on Goal 16 to see that overall the picture is very mixed. Sadly many indicators are going backwards. Press freedom, internet access are challenges in many countries. Over half the world is still offline."

    "text": "Sharing your stories\nIf you are interested to get more involved in looking at how to measure your own contribution to the SDGs, where should you start? It’s really important to remember that the relative importance of different goals varies widely between countries, and even institutions. I often describe the SDGs as just one tool in your toolkit that is more relevant for some advocacy purposes than others. You must consider who you are speaking to and consider whether or not the SDGs are relevant in your context.\nSo with that in mind, I spoke earlier about the stories you can tell and the data available from different sources to make the case. There is a huge amount of resources and documentation now, I would suggest starting by looking at:\n\nYour own library’s plans and objectives - there are a couple of libraries that have already mapped their work in this way\nYour institution’s strategic plan, particularly if they mention global challenges or the SDGs\nALIA, LIANZA, CAUL, CONZUL resources\nSDSN Universities guide\nIFLA for the global perspective\n\nWork with other people to gather stories, data, and think about how you will communicate it. I encourage you to get engaged with the SDGs and other activities like the UNESCO draft recommendation on Open Science to keep the pressure on to make the most of opportunities at every level locally and nationally to show the difference libraries, information, and open access makes. As librarians we live the SDGs every day: we innovate, we educate, we support sustainability, and equity – the SDGs are not just a report card, they are at the heart of what we do. It’s up to us now to tell others about it."
